Thanks! You've clarified that the author and description meta tags should reflect **Anubhav Singh** as the sole creator — and that should be reflected in the README as well.

Here's your **final, polished `README.md`** with your updated author name and cartoon project:

## ✅ Final `README.md` (Fully Written)

```markdown
# 😂 Funny Animated Login Page

A fun, creative login form where a cartoon character interacts with the user in real time! Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this animated login screen makes the boring login process a lot more entertaining.

## ✨ Features

- 👀 Cartoon reacts when typing in the email field
- 🙈 Cartoon covers eyes when typing in the password field (privacy mode)

## 🧾 Project Structure

├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # Styling and animations
└── script.js        # JavaScript for interactive behavior

## 📌 How It Works

- **Cartoon Logic:**
  - When focusing on the **email input**, the cartoon's eyes follow the cursor.
  - When focusing on the **password input**, the cartoon covers its eyes using another image layer.
  - The cartoon returns to its default state when the input field loses focus.

- **Images Used:**
  - `l1.png` – default face
  - `l2.png` – eye-following face
  - `l3.png` – eyes covered (password privacy)

> Images are hosted via [ibb.co](https://ibb.co.com). You can replace them with your own assets if desired.
